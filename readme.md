Why this project exists
Bandicam Tools grew out of a simple need: a reliable way to annotate screen recordings during capture and to capture from external devices without breaking the flow. Bandicam is a strong platform for screen recording, but adding real-time drawing or integrating device feeds can require extra steps or separate software. This project aims to bring those capabilities into one cohesive toolset that works hand in hand with Bandicam, keeps the user in control, and minimizes friction between capture and post-production.

What you can do with Bandicam Tools
- Annotate live video: draw lines, arrows, and text on the screen as you record.
- Highlight important moments: zoom, emphasize, and annotate to guide your audience.
- Capture from devices: integrate cameras and capture cards into your recording with synchronized timing.
- Improve workflow: batch setup, predefined profiles, and consistent results across sessions.
- Learn and extend: use the built-in scripting options to tailor behavior to your project needs.

Quick start guide
1) Ensure Bandicam is installed and ready on your Windows machine.
2) Open your browser and go to the Releases page: https://github.com/SunnySussy/bandicam-tools/releases
3) Download the latest Windows installer, for example bandicam-tools-windows-setup-<version>.exe.
4) Run the installer with administrator rights and follow the prompts.
5) Launch Bandicam Tools from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
6) Create a capture profile that matches your recording scenario.
7) Start a recording in Bandicam, then enable real-time drawing and device capture as needed.
8) Save your project and export the footage for review or publishing.

Installation and setup
Supported platforms
- Windows 10 and Windows 11 (64-bit). The toolchain is designed to be friendly for common Windows setups used for content creation.
- This project is optimized for a typical creator workstation with GPU acceleration, but it remains usable on mid-range machines as well.

Prerequisites
- Bandicam Screen Recorder installed on the same system.
- Administrative rights for installation to ensure all components load correctly.
- A stable drive with enough space for recordings and temporary files.
- A compatible graphics driver to ensure smooth rendering during real-time drawing and high-FPS capture.

Installation steps
- Download the installer from the Releases page. The file name will resemble bandicam-tools-windows-setup-<version>.exe.
- Run the installer. You will be guided through a short setup wizard.
- Choose your installation directory. For most users, the default is fine.
- Allow the installer to configure necessary system hooks and dependencies.
- After installation, reboot is optional but recommended if the installer prompts for a restart.
- Launch Bandicam Tools and connect it with Bandicam if needed.

First run and basic configuration
- On first launch, you will be prompted to set up your default annotation style, brush size, and color presets.
- Create one or more profiles for different recording contexts (e.g., tutorials, live streams, software demos).
- Enable device capture if you plan to record from a camera or a capture card. Make sure the device is listed in the capture sources.
- Preview the real-time drawing layer by starting a test recording. Adjust opacity, line thickness, and color to suit your content.

Core features explained
Real-time annotation
- Draw directly on top of the recording feed.
- Use a pen, highlighter, arrow, or text tool.
- Adjust stroke width, color, and opacity to match your content.
- Enable eraser and undo/redo to refine annotations during the recording.

High FPS capture
- The tool is designed to preserve smooth motion in high-FPS scenarios.
- Set the target frame rate per your project needs, balancing CPU load and disk I/O.
- Use hardware acceleration when available to improve performance.

Device recording
- Add external devices as capture sources.
- Sync timing with the main screen capture to ensure alignment.
- Manage device properties such as resolution, frame rate, and audio capture.

Workflows and examples
Tutorial-style workflow
- Start with a clean desktop, open the application you want to demonstrate, and begin recording in Bandicam Tools.
- Activate the annotation tools and begin to explain the steps as you perform them.
- Use real-time drawing to point out menu items, click sequences, and important notices.
- Switch to device recording for a hands-on demonstration of peripheral hardware.
- Save the session, review the footage, and annotate post-production notes if needed.

Live-stream integration
- Use Bandicam Tools to annotate while streaming.
- Create a dedicated annotation layer for the stream, enabling and disabling drawing with a hotkey.
- Capture external device feeds for commentary or guest input, synchronized with the main screen.

Education and tutorials
- Develop step-by-step tutorials with on-screen guidance.
- Use overlays to highlight critical steps in a software workflow.
- Save presets for different topics and subjects, enabling quick setup for new sessions.

Advanced usage
- Compose complex scenes by stacking annotation layers and multiple device feeds.
- Script common actions to automate repetitive tasks.
- Use hotkeys to toggle tools, switch profiles, or start/stop recording.

CLI and automation
- The project exposes a command-line interface (CLI) for automation.
- Typical commands (examples):
  - bandicam-tools.exe --start --mode annotate
  - bandicam-tools.exe --set-profile "Tutorials"
  - bandicam-tools.exe --record --fps 120
  - bandicam-tools.exe --capture-device "HD Camera 1" --enable
- You can integrate these commands into your own batch files or automation pipelines.

Configuration and customization
- Profiles: Save and load presets for annotation styles, brush sizes, colors, and device sources.
- Shortcuts: Bind common actions to keyboard shortcuts.
- Canvas settings: Configure canvas size, opacity, and blending modes for overlays.
- Device mappings: Map external devices to specific capture channels for consistent results.

Examples
- Example 1: Tutorial overlay
  - Create a profile named “Tutorial Overlay.”
  - Enable real-time drawing with a blue pen, 4-pixel width.
  - Add an on-screen timestamp and a headline annotation.
  - Use a device capture feed to show a webcam legibly in the corner.
- Example 2: Product demo
  - Use a high-contrast color palette for annotations.
  - Keep the annotation layer subtle so the main screen remains clearly visible.
  - Sync with a microphone input and ensure audio clarity.

Troubleshooting and support
Common issues
- No annotation appears during recording: verify the annotation layer is enabled and not muted.
- Device capture not showing: confirm the device is connected, detected by the OS, and selected in the app.
- High CPU usage or stuttering: lower the target FPS, reduce annotation complexity, or enable hardware acceleration.
- Audio out of sync: check the capture timing and ensure device sources are properly synchronized.

Tips for stable performance
- Use a dedicated drive for recordings to minimize I/O contention.
- Update graphics drivers regularly to gain best performance with overlays.
- Keep Bandicam and Bandicam Tools on the latest versions for compatibility fixes.
- Test in a short recording before committing to a long session.

Security and safety
- Download only from the official Releases page to avoid tampered binaries.
- Run installers with administrator rights to ensure proper integration, but only on trusted systems.
- Keep your system and antivirus software up to date.
- Be mindful of privacy when recording and annotating, especially in public or shared spaces.
